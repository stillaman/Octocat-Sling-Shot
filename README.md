### Octocat-Sling-Shot


# What it does
Quite an interesting game featuring our beloved Octocat with deep blue background (cause it’s an aquarium and we didn’t want disturbance by using wallpaper so we went for texture instead), Basically it’s a soothing game without any score counters as it would make some people anxious and we surely don’t want to do that in this fun weekend hahaha, Also Octocat is moving in the foreground which kind of adds little bit happiness to the whole theme.

# How we built it
We used Matter.js engine to include properties like Vector, Torque, Velocity, Momentum, and Gravity to objects.

# Challenges we ran into
We were using the Matter.js engine for the first time, so it took some time to get familiar with the command but after a couple of trials of errors we could complete the slingshot game.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We just love it, I mean we created it to just have fun and rest it does work hehehe

# What we learned
We learned backend integration, the proper way to use matter.js, include properties like two-dimensional vector fields (wireframe) , Velocity, define speed limit,
